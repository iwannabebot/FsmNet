# What is SharpFsm?

A flexible finite state machine (FSM) library for .NET written in C#, it is designed to create and manage Finite State Machines (FSMs) in a simple and efficient way. It allows developers to define states, transitions, and events, enabling the modeling of complex behaviors in a structured manner.

# Features
- **State Management**: Easily define and manage states in your FSM. Strongly-typed FSMs using enums for states
- **Transition Handling**: Transition conditions and side effects.
- **Serialization**: Serialization to/from JSON and YAML.
- **Builder Pattern**: Builder pattern for easy FSM construction.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend the library to fit specific needs or integrate with other systems.
- **Cross-Platform**: Multi-targeted for broad .NET compatibility


# Advantage of using FSM

Using a finite state machine (FSM) for managing state offers several advantages over ad-hoc approaches (like scattered conditionals, flags, or event-driven code) and even over some object-oriented state patterns. Here are the key benefits:

1. Clarity and Explicitness
    - All possible states and transitions are explicitly defined.
    - The system’s behavior is easy to visualize, reason about, and document.
    - Reduces ambiguity and hidden state changes.
2. Predictability and Robustness
    - Transitions are controlled and validated.
    - Only allowed transitions can occur, preventing invalid or unexpected state changes.
    - Makes it easier to handle edge cases and errors.
3. Maintainability
    - Adding or modifying states and transitions is straightforward.
    - Changes are localized to the FSM definition, not scattered across the codebase.
    - Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when requirements change.
4. Testability
    - FSMs are easy to test.
    - You can systematically test all states and transitions.
    - Makes it easier to write unit tests for state-dependent logic.
5. Separation of Concerns
    - State logic is separated from business logic.
    - Conditions and side effects are encapsulated, making the codebase cleaner and more modular.
6. Scalability
    - FSMs scale well as complexity grows.
    - Adding new states or transitions does not exponentially increase code complexity, unlike nested if/else or switch statements.
7. Visualization and Documentation
    - FSMs can be visualized as state diagrams.
    - This aids in communication with stakeholders and helps onboard new developers.

| Approach         | Pros of FSM over this approach                       | 
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| If/else, switch  | Avoids spaghetti code, centralizes state logic       |
| Flags/booleans   | Prevents invalid state combinations                  |
| Event-driven     | Makes allowed transitions explicit and predictable   |
| State pattern    | FSM is more declarative and easier to visualize      |

# Use Cases
Here are some common use cases for implementing a finite state machine (FSM) in software development:

1. Workflow and Process Management
    - Example: Ticketing systems, order processing, approval workflows.
    - Why: Each item moves through a series of well-defined states (e.g., Open → In Progress → Resolved).
2. User Interface (UI) Navigation
    - Example: Wizard dialogs, multi-step forms, menu navigation.
    - Why: UI components often have distinct states and transitions based on user actions.
3. Game Development
    - Example: Character states (Idle, Walking, Jumping, Attacking), enemy AI behaviors.
    - Why: Game entities often have clear, rule-based state transitions.
4. Protocol and Communication Handling
    - Example: Network protocol implementations (TCP handshake, HTTP request/response), parsers.
    - Why: Protocols are defined by sequences of states and transitions based on received data.
5. Device and Hardware Control
    - Example: Embedded systems, robotics, IoT devices (e.g., a washing machine: Idle → Washing → Rinsing → Spinning → Done).
    - Why: Devices operate in modes with strict rules for moving between them.
6. Authentication and Authorization Flows
    - Example: Login processes, multi-factor authentication, session management.
    - Why: Security flows require strict control over allowed transitions.
7. Error Handling and Recovery
    - Example: Retry logic, circuit breakers, transaction management.
    - Why: Systems need to move between normal, error, and recovery states in a controlled way.
8. Text Parsing and Lexical Analysis
    - Example: Tokenizers, interpreters, compilers.
    - Why: Parsing often involves moving through states based on input characters or tokens.
