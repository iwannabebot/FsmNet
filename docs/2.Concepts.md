Understanding the core building blocks of SharpFsm will help you design cleaner, maintainable, and more expressive state machines.

# 📌 State
A state represents a distinct condition or situation in the lifecycle of an object or process.

## How to Define States
States are typically defined using an `enum` for strong typing:
```csharp
public enum TicketState
{
    New,
    InProgress,
    Resolved,
    Closed
}
```
## Best Practices
- Use clear and descriptive names (e.g., `PendingReview` > `Pending`).
- Keep the enum definition in a shared or domain-specific namespace.
- Avoid ambiguous or overloaded terms.

# 🔁 Transition
A transition defines how the FSM moves from one state to another.
Each transition can specify:
- Source state: where the transition starts
- Target state: where it ends
- Condition (optional): a predicate to allow or deny the transition
- Side effect (optional): an action to run during the transition

## Example
```csharp
.AddTransition(TicketState.New, TicketState.InProgress)
    .When(ctx => ctx.IsAgentAssigned)
    .WithSideEffect(ctx => Console.WriteLine("Notified agent"))
    .Done()
```
## Condition
A condition (or guard) is a predicate function used to determine if a transition should proceed.
```csharp
ctx => ctx.IsAgentAssigned
```
> Return `true` to allow the transition, `false` to block it.

## Side Effect
A side effect is a piece of logic executed during a transition. Use it for logging, notifications, or state synchronization.
```csharp
(ctx) => Console.WriteLine("Customer notified")
```

# 📦 Context
The context is an object passed into transitions that contains runtime data.

## Example
```csharp
public class TicketContext
{
    public bool IsAgentAssigned { get; set; }
    public string CustomerEmail { get; set; }
}
```
## Usage
```csharp
AddTransition(TicketState.New, TicketState.InProgress)
    .When(ctx => ctx.IsAgentAssigned)
    .WithSideEffect((ctx) => Notify(ctx.CustomerEmail))
```

# 🧬 State Machine Definition
A state machine definition encapsulates:
- All valid states
- All transitions between those states
- The initial state
- Any associated logic (guards, side effects, outputs)

This definition is used to construct a state machine instance via a builder.
```csharp
var context = new TicketContext { IsAgentAssigned = false, CustomerEmail = "test@test.com" };
var definition = FiniteStateMachineBuilder<TicketState, TicketContext>.Create("Ticket")
    .WithInitialState(TicketState.New)
    .AddTransition(TicketState.New, TicketState.InProgress)
        .When(ctx => ctx.IsAgentAssigned)
        .WithSideEffect((ctx) => Notify(ctx.CustomerEmail))
        .Done()
    .Build();
var fsm = new FiniteStateMachine<TicketState, TicketContext>(definition);
fsm.TryTransitionTo(TicketState.InProgress, context); // Does not move to InProgress
context.IsAgentAssigned = true;
fsm.TryTransitionTo(TicketState.InProgress, context); // Moves to InProgress
```
